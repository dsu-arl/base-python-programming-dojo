
A list is a built-in data type in Python. A Python list is a sequence of comma seperated items, enclosed in square brackets. Every item in a list can be made up of any type of variable we have learned about so far, and they don't necessarily be the same type. 
**Examples of Python Lists:**
```
list1 = ["Thomas", "Jefferson", "President", 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list3 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
```
