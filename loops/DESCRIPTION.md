Python supports Iterative Statements (Loops) and allow us to execute a statment or group of statements multiple times.

In general, programs are executed sequentially: the first statement in a program is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There can be situations in which you may need to execute a block of code several times, and that's where loops become beneficial.
