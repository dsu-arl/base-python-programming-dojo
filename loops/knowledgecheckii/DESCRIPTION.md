# Knowledge Check I

This challenge is going to test your python knowledge up to this point!

# Challenge 

Create a program that traverses a list looking for the string 'waldo'. Your program should print out what position 'waldo' is in the list.

You will need to use the `range` function to loop through the list! Here is an example of what this looks like:

```Python
# This code uses a for loop, and range,
# to loop through a list and print out
# each item.


for x in range(0,len(my_list)):
    print(my_list[x])
```

**Print out only the index number!**

## Getting your list
Run `/challenge/list` to generate your list. Then copy and paste that list into your code.

To test your code, run `verify <your_python_file.py>`, and get the flag!
