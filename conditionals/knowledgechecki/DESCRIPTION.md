# Knowledge Check I

This challenge is going to test what you have learned in the conditionals module!

# Challenge 

In this challenge, you will create a program that takes in three inputs from the user:
1. A number.
2. One of the following math operators (+, -, \*, /).
3. A number.

Your program will identify what math operator is selected and then perform the operation, printing out the answer to the screen!

To test your code, run `verify <your_python_file.py>`, and get the flag!
