Lastly, Python also supports **logical operators**, these allow you to combine two or more conditionals in one statement. These are the supported logical operators we care about at this time:
| Operator | Name | Example |
|---|---|---|
| and | AND | CONDITIONAL1 and CONDITIONAL2 |
| or | OR | CONDITIONAL1 or CONDITIONAL2 |

**Example ofPython Logical Operators:**
```
number = 5
print(var > 3 and var < 10)
print(var > 3 or var < 4)
```

One thing to note, logical operators can be used inside of `if` and `elif` conditionals. If you use `and` the statement evaluates to `true` only if all the conditionals are `true`. If you use `or` the statement evaluates to `true` if one of the conditionals is `true`.
