Lastly, Python also supports **logical operators**, these allow you to combine two or more conditionals in one statement. These are the supported logical operators we care about at this time:

<table> <thead> <tr> <th>Operator</th> <th>Name</th> <th>Example</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>and</td> <td>AND</td> <td>CONDITIONAL1 and CONDITIONAL2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>or</td> <td>OR</td> <td>CONDITIONAL1 or CONDITIONAL2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

**Example ofPython Logical Operators:**
```
number = 5
print(var > 3 and var < 10)
print(var > 3 or var < 4)
```

One thing to note, logical operators can be used inside of `if` and `elif` conditionals. If you use `and` the statement evaluates to `true` only if all the conditionals are `true`. If you use `or` the statement evaluates to `true` if one of the conditionals is `true`.
