We have reached the point where you understand that programs cannot be truly useful following a sequential flow. Conditionals and Loops provide us with a great way to break up a program and its control flow, but by far the most valuable control flow mechanism for programming is functions.

Functions are a way to organize code, specifically a block of code, so it can be used throughout a program. They should be written in a way that they perform a single, related action. If done correctly, they will make a program more modular by allowing you to reuse code. 

Python provides three different types of functions:
- Built-in Functions
- Built-in Module Functions
- User-defined Functions

This module is all about learning Python functions. Topics to be covered: Built-in Functions, Module Functions, User-Defined Functions, Calling Functons, Arguments, and Return Values.
