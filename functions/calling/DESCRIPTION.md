This brings up a good point though, how do we call a function?

Defining a function only gives it a name, specifies the parameters that are to be used in the function, and structures the blocks of code to be included in the function. But, you need to be able to use that. The way to call a function is very similar to the way we called some of the built-in functions, like `print()` and `int()`. They are called by simply using the functions name. Using the `greeting()` function above, I will demonstrate how we would call it:
```
# Function Definition
def greeting():
	print("Hello World")
  return
  
# Main Program, we want to call it here
greeting()
```
When the above code is executed, it produces the following output:
```
Hello World!
```

You should no be able to successfully define and call your own user-defined functions, but we need to learn some new concepts to make these functions even more useful.
