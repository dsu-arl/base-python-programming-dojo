Lastly, Python allows you to define your own functions. This is what we care about the most, as it allows you to write code that does a specific task and use it throughout your program. In this module  we will focus on teaching you how to define your own functions (the syntax), how to pass arguments, and return values. 

#### Python Function Syntax:
Python function definition follows these rules:
- Function blocks begin with the keyword `def` followed by the function name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`
- The code block then starts and must be indented
- Finally, the statement `return` exits a function

Put that all together and you will get something that looks like this:
```
def FUNCTION_NAME():
	# Function Code Block Starts
  # Statement(s) to be executed
  return
```

Taking what we learned in the very first module, we can write a hello world greeting function. It would look like this:
```
def greeting():
	print("Hello World!")
  return
```
Now that this is created anytime we call the function `greeting`, "Hello World!" will be printed.
