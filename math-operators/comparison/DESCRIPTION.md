Programming involves alot more than just doing math on numbers. Another important aspect to programming is comparison. Comparison Operators return `true` or `false` based on how the variables are compared, we will cover this in more detail later, but for now understanding how they look and what they return is important. The following **Comparison Operators** are important to know:

| Operator | Name | Example |
|---|---|---|
| == | Equal | `a==b`, returns `true` if `a` is the same as `b` |
| != | Not Equal | `a!=b`, returns `true` if `a` is not the same as `b` |
| > | Greater Than | `a>b`, returns `true` if `a` is greater than `b` |
| < | Less Than | `a<b`, returns `true` if `a` is less than `b` |
| >= | Greater Than or Equal to | `a>=b`, returns `true` if `a` is greater than or equal to `b` |
| <= | Less Than or Equal to | `a<=b`, returns `true` if `a` is less than or equal to `b` |

#### Challenge:
Use python to read two numbers from the user and detect if the first number is smaller than the second.

1. Create a new file with the file extension `.py`
2. Write the python code to read in two numbers from a user
3. Use **comparison operators** to print **True**, if the first number is less than or equal to the second number. If this is not the case, print False
4. Test your code with `python yourFile.py`
5. Verify your solution with `verify yourFile.py`
