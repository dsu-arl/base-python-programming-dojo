# Knowledge Check II

Now that you've gotten to play around with basic math in Python, we are going to test your knowledge!

# Challenge:

Take in two numbers and, using floor division and the modulus operator, tell us how many times the second number fits into the first number, and what the remainder would be.

## Example:

```python
Enter first number: 100
Enter second number: 3

3 goes into 100 33 times with a remainder of 1.
```

Run `verify <your_python_file.py>` to check your code and get the flag!
