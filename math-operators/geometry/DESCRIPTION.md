Lets put your skills to the test! There are many common formulas that mathematicians need to memorize! In geometry, for example...

**Finding the Area of shapes**  
Circle: Ï€*r<sup>2</sup>   
Square: s<sup>2</sup>  
Triangle: 0.5 * b * h  
Trapezoid: ((a + b) / 2) * h  

#### Challenge:
Use python to read in the width and height of a triangle, then calculate and print the area.

1. Create a new file with the file extension `.py`
2. Write the python code to get two numbers from the user (triangle width and height)
3. Use the formula to calculate the area of a triangle and print the result!
4. Test your code with `python yourFile.py`
5. Verify your solution with `verify yourFile.py`
