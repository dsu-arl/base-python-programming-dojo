Lets put your skills to the test! There are many common formulas that mathematicians need to memorize! In geometry, for example...

**Finding the Area of shapes**  
Circle: Ï€*r<sup>2</sup>   
Square: s<sup>2</sup>  
Triangle: 0.5 * b * h  
Trapezoid: ((a + b) / 2) * h  

To find the area of a square:
```python
s = int(input("Length of side: "))
area = s**2 # ** to find exponent

print("Area = ", area)
```

```bash
# example output
Length of side: 5
Area =  25
```

#### Challenge:
Use python to read in the width and height of a triangle, then calculate and print the area.

Note: The area will be a float data type! You can get user input as either ints or floats. Python will handle converting the types when you do the math!

1. Create a new file with the file extension `.py`
2. Write the python code to get two numbers from the user (triangle base and height)
3. Use the formula to calculate the area of a triangle and print the result!
```bash
# example output
Base: 3
Height: 5
Area =  7.5
```
4. Test your code with `python yourFile.py`
5. Verify your solution with `verify yourFile.py`
