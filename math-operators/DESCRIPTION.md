All about learning Python math operators and their use cases.

Now that you know how to get input from a user, you need to learn how to do things with that input. The first thing we are going to cover is math operators. Python supports many different **Math Operators**, the following are what we care about right now:

| Operator | Name | Example |
|---|---|---|
| + | Addition | `a+b` |
| - | Subtraction | `a-b` |
| * | Multiplication | `a*b` |
| / | Division | `a/b` |
| % | Modulus | `a*b` |
| ** | Exponent | `a**b` |
| // | Floor Division | `a//b` |

Every operator is should be familiar with you besides Modulus and Floor Division. Modulus is like division, but returns the remainder. For example, `4%2` would return 0 since `2` can fit into `4` exactly twice. What would `5%2` return? 

Floor division is rather straight forward. It is just like division, but will round down if there is a remainder. For example, `5//2` would return `2`, whereas `5/2` would return `2.5`.
