Now that you know how to get input from a user, you need to learn how to do things with that input. The first thing we are going to cover is math operators. Python supports many different **Math Operators**, the following are what we care about right now:

| Operator | Name | Example |
|---|---|---|
| + | Addition | `a+b` |
| - | Subtraction | `a-b` |
| * | Multiplication | `a*b` |
| / | Division | `a/b` |
| % | Modulus | `a*b` |
| ** | Exponent | `a**b` |
| // | Floor Division | `a//b` |

Every operator is should be familiar with you besides Modulus and Floor Division. Modulus is like division, but returns the remainder. For example, `4%2` would return 0 since `2` can fit into `4` exactly twice. What would `5%2` return? 

Floor division is rather straight forward. It is just like division, but will round down if there is a remainder. For example, `5//2` would return `2`, whereas `5/2` would return `2.5`. 

#### Challenge:
Use python to print the text 'Hello World!' to the screen.

1. Create a new file with the file extension `.py`
2. Write the python code to get a number from the user (Don't forget to typecast)
3. Use modulus to show if the number is odd or even by printing a 1 (odd) or 0 (even) *(Remember even numbers are always divisible by two)*
4. Test your code with `python yourFile.py`
5. Verify your solution with `verify yourFile.py`
