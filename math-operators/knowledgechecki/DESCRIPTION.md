# Knowledge Check I

Now that you've gotten to play around with basic math in Python, we are going to test your knowledge!

# Challenge:

In this challenge, you will make a math test with 5 questions! You will need to read in answers for each question and check to make sure they're correct! At the end, tally the score and give them their percentage grade!

Use input to display the math equation and read in their answer. Then check the answer and keep track of which ones they get wrong or right.

Run `verify <your_python_file.py>` to check your code and get the flag!
