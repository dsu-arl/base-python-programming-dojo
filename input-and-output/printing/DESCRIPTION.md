The first thing to learn when programming is how to print information to the screen, as a program is only useful if you can see its results. In Python, to print to the screen, we will use the `print()` function (We will cover functions in  more detail later).

#### Print Syntax:
```commandline
print(STRING MESSAGE TO PRINT)
```


For Example:
```commandline
print("My Output!!")
```
When run this will display the following:
```commandline
My Output!!
```


***Challenge:*** Use python to print the text 'Hello World!' to the screen.
