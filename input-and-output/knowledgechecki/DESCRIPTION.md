# Knowledge Check I

That was quite a bit of learning you just did! This challenge will pull together some of the concepts from the previous challenges to help you hammer them down and become more comfortable with them. 

# Challenge:

Use Python to create a short 1-sentence Mad Lib. If you don't know what a MadLib is, you can click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) to see what they are. In short, you will have a pre-written sentence that is missing a few words (verbs, nouns, adjectives), and then you will ask the user to supply the missing words.

Let me show you an example!

Here is our incomplete sentence:
`Hello, {Name}! Welcome to {Place} where we make {Plural Noun}.`

You would then ask the user for words to fill in the sentence. That may look something like this:

```python
Please give me a Name: Carl
Please give me a Place: Taco Bell
Please give me a Noun: Hamburgers

Here is your Mad Lib!

Hello, Carl! Welcome to Taco Bell, where we make Hamburgers.
```

In this challenge use printing, user input, and format a string to create a user generated MadLib!

Run `verify yourFile.py` to verify your solution!
