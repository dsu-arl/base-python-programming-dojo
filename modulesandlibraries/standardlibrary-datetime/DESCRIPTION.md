# Standard Library: datetime

In this challenge, we will utilize a module inside the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html). This module allows us to create date time objects within our program. This is great if we need to keep time in our program, or schedule things. 

The goal in this challenge is to use our knowledge of importing to use the `datetime` module within a program. Since reading documentation is a large part of programming, I will not tell you which specific functions you will use in the program. Instead, use the 'Python Standard Library' link to view the documentation for the `datetime` module, and use that to solve this challenge. [This website](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp) will also be helpful.

There is a lot to the `datetime` module, but we will just be showing you a few of the basic functions that are commonly used in programs. 

Create a python file that:
1. Gets the current date and time.
2. Get today's date.
3. Create a datetime object for April 14th, 1999 at 5:30am.

Run `/challenge/verify <your_python_file.py>` to get the flag!
