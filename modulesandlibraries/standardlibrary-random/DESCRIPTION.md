# Standard Library: random

In this challenge, we will utilize a module inside the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html). This module allows us to add a sense of randomness to our programs.

The goal in this challenge is to use our knowledge of importing to use the `random` module within a program. Since reading documentation is a large part of programming, I will not tell you which specific functions you will use in the program. Instead, use the 'Python Standard Library' link to view the documentation for the `random` module, and use that to solve this challenge. 

There is a lot to the `random` module, but we will just be showing you two of the basic functions that are commonly used in programs. 

Create a python file that:
1. Generates a random integer, and prints it out.
2. Picks a random item from a list of grocery items, and prints it out.

Run `/challenge/verify <your_python_file.py>` to get the flag!
