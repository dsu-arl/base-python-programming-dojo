# Standard Library: sys

In this challenge, we will utilize a module inside the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html). This module allows us to interact with different system utilities, as well as get system information that we may need to know. 

The goal in this challenge is to use our knowledge of importing to use the `sys` module within a program. Since reading documentation is a large part of programming, I will not tell you which specific functions you will use in the program. Instead, use the 'Python Standard Library' link to view the documentation for the `sys` module, and use that to solve this challenge.

There is a lot to the `sys` module, but we will just be showing you a few of the basic functions that are commonly used in programs. 

Create a python file that:
1. Takes in command line arguments, and prints it out to the screen.
2. Prints out the python version information.
4. Prints out the path that python uses to load modules.
5. Exits with code 0.
 
Run `/challenge/verify <your_python_file.py>` to get the flag!
