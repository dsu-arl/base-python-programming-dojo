# Standard Library: os

In this challenge, we will utilize a module inside the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html). This module allows us to interact with the operating system from within our program. 

The goal in this challenge is to use our knowledge of importing to use the `os` module within a program. Since reading documentation is a large part of programming, I will not tell you which specific functions you will use in the program. Instead, use the 'Python Standard Library' link to view the documentation for the `os` module, and use that to solve this challenge. 

There is a lot to the `os` module, but we will just be showing you a few of the basic functions that are commonly used in programs. 

Create a python file that:
1. List's the current working directory of your python program.
2. Prints out the contents of the `/tmp` directory.
3. Makes a directory called `workdir` in your current working directory.

Run `/challenge/verify <your_python_file.py>` to get the flag!
